# Vrv Downloader

It's an app which helps you download videos off VRV.I had only tried to download crunchyroll anime off it,premium anime won't work so does Hidive unless you have a premium account which you could try with the "Requires Premium" box.No gurantees It would work since I don't own a premium account.

Some code isn't that well done since I'm self thought so expect bugs/errors,also report via the Issues if they aries I would try my best to fix.

## Here's a Preview of it

## To Do's  
- [x] Dependencies extract showing no progress.
- [x] Ability to save to the same folder instead of selecting save path everytime
- [x] Save in multiple format instead of mp4

- [ ] Ability to change themes/background
- [ ] Add proxy support/Geo bypass(Unable to get it work always 404 or 403 on my side with geo-bypass and proxy)

## Updates/Bug Fixes would happen when I have the time.
